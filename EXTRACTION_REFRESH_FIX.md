# ✅ Fix: Extraction List Auto-Refresh for Concurrent Users

## 🎯 Problem Identified

When user Micka tries to extract stems while administrator is already extracting the same video:
1. ✅ Micka gets "currently extracted by another user" popup - **WORKS**
2. ✅ Micka waits for administrator's extraction to complete - **WORKS**  
3. ❌ Micka's extraction list doesn't refresh automatically - **WAS BROKEN**
4. ❌ Micka needs manual refresh to see the new extraction - **WAS BROKEN**

## 🔧 Root Cause

The extraction completion WebSocket notification was only sent to the **user who initiated the extraction**, not to all users. This meant other users didn't know when new extractions became available.

### Before Fix:
```python
# Only sent to the user who started the extraction
socketio.emit('extraction_complete', {
    'extraction_id': item_id,
    'video_id': video_id,
    'title': title
}, room=room_key or self._key())  # ← Only specific user's room
```

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Fix (app.py)
Added **global broadcast** in addition to the user-specific notification:

```python
# Send to the specific user who initiated the extraction
socketio.emit('extraction_complete', {
    'extraction_id': item_id,
    'video_id': video_id,
    'title': title
}, room=room_key or self._key())

# ALSO send a global broadcast to ALL users
socketio.emit('extraction_completed_global', {
    'extraction_id': item_id,
    'video_id': video_id,
    'title': title
})  # ← No room restriction = global broadcast
```

### 2. Frontend Fix (static/js/app.js)
Added handler for the global extraction completion event:

```javascript
socket.on('extraction_completed_global', (data) => {
    console.log('Global extraction completed:', data);
    
    // Refresh the extractions list to show the new extraction
    loadExtractions();
    
    // Also refresh downloads list to update "Extract Stems" buttons
    loadDownloads();
    
    // Show a subtle notification
    showToast(`New extraction available: ${data.title}`, 'info');
});
```

## 🎬 Expected Flow Now

### Scenario: Administrator extracts while Micka waits

1. **Administrator starts extraction** → Extraction begins
2. **Micka tries to extract same video** → Gets "currently extracted by another user" popup ✅
3. **Micka waits** → Popup closes, Micka stays on extractions tab
4. **Administrator's extraction completes** → Global broadcast sent 🆕
5. **Micka's UI auto-refreshes** → New extraction appears in list automatically ✅
6. **Micka sees notification** → "New extraction available: [title]" toast ✅

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **No Manual Refresh Needed** → Users see new extractions immediately
2. **Better UX** → Smooth experience when waiting for concurrent extractions  
3. **Real-time Updates** → All users stay in sync with extraction availability
4. **Subtle Notifications** → Users know when new extractions become available
5. **Automatic Button Updates** → Download tab "Extract Stems" buttons also refresh

## 🧪 Test Scenario

To test the fix:

1. **Login as Administrator** → Start extracting a video
2. **Login as Micka (different browser/incognito)** → Try to extract same video
3. **Verify popup appears** → "Currently extracted by another user"
4. **Wait on extractions tab** → Keep extractions tab open
5. **Wait for completion** → Administrator's extraction finishes
6. **Check Micka's screen** → Should automatically show the new extraction + toast notification

## 📊 Technical Details

- **Event Name**: `extraction_completed_global`
- **Broadcast**: No room restriction (all connected users)
- **Actions**: Refreshes extractions list, downloads list, shows toast
- **Backward Compatible**: Original `extraction_complete` event still works for initiating user

The fix ensures that **all users benefit** when **any user** completes an extraction, improving the collaborative nature of StemTube!

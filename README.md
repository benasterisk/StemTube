## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- 4GB+ RAM recommended
- NVIDIA GPU (optional, for faster processing)

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Benasterisk/StemTube.git
cd StemTube
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the application**:
```bash
python app.py
```

3. **Access the interface**:

# StemTube Cleanup Utility

A utility script to safely clean up downloads and extractions from StemTube while preserving user accounts.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Safe Cleanup**: Removes downloads and extractions from database and filesystem
- ‚úÖ **Preserves Users**: User accounts and authentication data remain intact
- ‚úÖ **Database Backup**: Optional automatic database backup before cleanup
- ‚úÖ **Date Filtering**: Option to keep recent downloads (last N days)
- ‚úÖ **Dry Run Mode**: Preview what would be deleted without actual deletion
- ‚úÖ **Detailed Stats**: Shows cleanup statistics and disk space freed
- ‚úÖ **Safety Checks**: Multiple confirmation prompts and error handling

## Quick Start

```bash
# Preview what would be deleted (safe)
python cleanup_downloads.py --dry-run

# Full cleanup with backup (recommended)
python cleanup_downloads.py --backup-db

# Keep downloads from last 7 days
python cleanup_downloads.py --keep-recent 7 --backup-db

# Force cleanup without prompts (dangerous!)
python cleanup_downloads.py --force --backup-db
```

## What Gets Deleted

### Database Tables
- ‚ùå `global_downloads` - All download records
- ‚ùå `user_downloads` - All user access records  
- ‚úÖ `users` - **PRESERVED** - User accounts remain intact

### Filesystem
- ‚ùå All directories in `core/downloads/`
- ‚ùå All audio files and stem extractions
- ‚ùå All ZIP archives

### What's Preserved
- ‚úÖ User accounts and passwords
- ‚úÖ Application settings (`core/config.json`)
- ‚úÖ Database structure (tables remain, just emptied)
- ‚úÖ Application code and dependencies

## Usage Examples

### Safe Preview
```bash
python cleanup_downloads.py --dry-run
```
Shows what would be deleted without making any changes.

### Recommended Cleanup
```bash
python cleanup_downloads.py --backup-db
```
Creates database backup, then cleans everything with confirmation prompts.

### Keep Recent Downloads
```bash
python cleanup_downloads.py --keep-recent 30 --backup-db
```
Deletes downloads older than 30 days, keeps recent ones.

### Automated Cleanup
```bash
python cleanup_downloads.py --force --backup-db
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **DANGEROUS**: Skips confirmation prompts - use in scripts only.

## Command Line Options

## Safety Features

1. **Multiple Confirmations**: Requires typing 'yes' to confirm dangerous operations
2. **Dry Run Mode**: Always test with `--dry-run` first
3. **Database Backup**: Automatic backup creation with `--backup-db`
4. **User Preservation**: User accounts are never touched
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of permission errors and missing files
6. **Detailed Logging**: Shows exactly what was deleted

## Recovery

If you need to recover after cleanup:

1. **Database**: Restore from backup created with `--backup-db`
2. **Files**: No recovery possible - files are permanently deleted
3. **Users**: User accounts are never deleted, no recovery needed

## Best Practices

1. **Always use `--dry-run` first** to preview changes
2. **Create backups** with `--backup-db` before real cleanup
3. **Consider `--keep-recent`** to preserve recent downloads
4. **Run during maintenance windows** when users aren't active
5. **Monitor disk space** before and after cleanup
6. **Restart StemTube app** after cleanup to clear cached data from memory

## Important Note About Memory Cache

‚ö†Ô∏è **After running cleanup, you must restart the StemTube application** to clear cached extraction data from memory. Otherwise, old extractions may still appear in the UI even though they've been deleted from the database and filesystem.

```bash
# After cleanup, restart the application
# Stop current instance (Ctrl+C if running in terminal)
# Then restart:
python app.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Errors
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x cleanup_downloads.py

# Run with proper permissions
sudo python cleanup_downloads.py --dry-run
```

### Import Errors
```bash
# Ensure you're in the StemTube root directory
cd /path/to/StemTube
python cleanup_downloads.py --dry-run
```

### Database Locked
Stop the StemTube application before running cleanup.

## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

**This operation cannot be undone!** 

- All downloads and extractions will be permanently deleted
- Files cannot be recovered from the filesystem
- Always use `--backup-db` for safety
- Test with `--dry-run` first

User accounts and authentication data are completely safe and will never be deleted.
